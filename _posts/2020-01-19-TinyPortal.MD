## Introduction:
What is TinyPortal?

TinyPortal is a mod for Elkarte that adds a powerful and mature CMS to your SMF Forum in minutes, with native integration, without having to worry about bridging, database, and appearance. Your Elkarte and TP will be a homogenous ensemble from installation. It's up to you and your creativity to use TP's features to customise your site and organise its content.

Features included in TinyPortal:

    Article System: The article system gives you a CMS system tightly integrated with your forum. Write articles in php, html or bbcode, and choose what member-groups can access them, who can contribute, and how they are approved.
    Blocks and Panels: Blocks is a term for the rectangles of information you can use throughout the portal. For the sake of simplicity the page has been divided into the "panels", which when combined can mimic many common page layouts. Blocks can contain regular html, BBC, php code or special written functions that collect specific types of information. You can show them according to which permissions the visitor has, and even show them just in certain sections.
    TinyPortal comes with a number of standard block types, such as: Recent Posts, Theme switcher, Search, Calendar, Poll, RSS feeds, Menu, User Profile block and News.
